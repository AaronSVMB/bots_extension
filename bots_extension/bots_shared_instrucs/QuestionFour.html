  Below are a series of questions regarding your period earnings. They will help you gain an understanding
  of the calculation of your earnings, which varies with your decision on how to invest your {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.

<p>
  <br> Each group member, including you, receives {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. Suppose you invest <strong>6 points</strong> to
  your <span style="color:mediumblue">Blue</span> Group's Joint Account and you invest <strong>11 points</strong> to your
  <span style="color:mediumseagreen">Green</span>  Green Group's Joint Account. Let's further suppose that the other
  members of your <span style="color:mediumblue">Blue</span> Group invest a combined <strong>18 points</strong> to the
  <span style="color:mediumblue">Blue</span> Joint Account and the other members of your
  <span style="color:mediumseagreen">Green</span> Group invest a combined <strong>31 points</strong> to the
  <span style="color:mediumseagreen">Green</span> Joint Account.
</p>
